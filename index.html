        <p>Tomorrow is a big day. Day 1 of a 16 week program to learn Java development. I’m rattled by nerves, fears. Am I too old? What if I run out of money? What if no one will hire me? Should I color my hair so the grey doesn’t show? I’m sure I’ll be the oldest one in the class and that bothers me a little. I hope this isn’t a stupid decision; I worry it’s me grasping at straws. If I fail, for whatever reason, it will be disastrous.
        </p>
        <p>I'm going to try my best to push all this aside. Focus on the work. I enjoy getting immersed in it and will try to trust the process. No quitting when I get scared or frustrated. It may be frowned upon, but I will also try to maintain balance and keep self-care in mind. Rest when I need rest, sleep when I need sleep, get outside and feed my soul.
        </p>
